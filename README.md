### Where is the fuzzy overhead from the first trailer?
The current implementation does not produce behavior 1-to-1 to the vanilla game.  It's very important for Training Mode to behave as similar as possible to Versus mode, so I have chosen to withold this feature until I can make something appropriate for the MBAACC community to practice with.

# How do I get the mod?

- [Download the latest .EXE from this link.](https://github.com/fangdreth/MBAACC-Extended-Training-Mode/releases)  

- The first time you run the .EXE, your anti-virus might warn you it is dangerous.  You can safely dismiss this message.  If you are curious, you see this because the training mod has code which modifies memory directly, which sets off the anti-virus.

- Run the .EXE while you have Melty Blood open.

And that's it.

# Building the mod yourself

Right now there isn't a CMAKE file, so if you want to build the mod yourself, get the [latest version of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and be sure to target x86.

# Save State Controls

First, save states must be enabled from the EXTENDED SETTINGS menu.  After that, a save state can be created anywhere (even while paused) by pressing F1 on your controller.  From that point, pressing F2 will restore that save state.  You can clear your save states by either holding up and pressing F1, or going into the EXTENDED SETTINGS menu and selecting CLEAR SAVE STATES.

Three save slots available.

# FAQ

### "Looking for MBAA.exe..." when MBAA.exe is already open
Check Task Manager too see if you have a zombie MBAA.exe process running.  You may have to restart your computer to kill this program.

### "VCRUNTIME140.dll" was not found
This means your VC++ redistributable is missing or needs repaired.  There are step-by-step instructions on Google, so you're best off searching this error to find the best way to fix it.

### Some of my settings change on their own
This is most likely because you are using the HITS UNTIL BURST option.  This setting requires MANUAL for the dummy and INFINITE for the meter, and turning HITS UNTIL BURST on automatically changes these.

### How do I get in touch?
My handle is Fang\_\_\_ (that's three underscores).  Message me on Discord.  I'm in most major Discords so you'll be able to find me pretty easily.

### Can I suggest features?
By all means.  Reach out to me on discord, but also make sure to read the Planned Features section first.  Don't think your idea is stupid--I'd love to discuss it, and who knows maybe it's already possible with clever settings.

### Can I contribute?
Sure.  Reach out and we can talk about it.

### Can I make my own version?
Yes you can, but I would prefer not having too many similar training mode mods floating around.  I have tried to make the code as readable and flexible as possible if you do choose this path, however.
